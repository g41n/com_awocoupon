<div class="desc">
	AwoCoupon for Virtuemart was created to fill a void within Virtuemart. 
	Although Virtuemart has coupon capabilities, they are not extensive enough
	to cover what many people would call basic coupon features.  AwoCoupon for Virtuemart
	fills this gap.  Here are a few of its features.
	<ul><li>Product(s) specific discounts</li>
		<li>Customer(s) specific discounts</li>
		<li>The ability to only trigger coupons if a minimum cart total is reached</li>
		<li>Ability to set expiration dates for coupons</li>
		<li>Restrict the number of times a coupon can be used by any given user</li>
		<li>Easy management of all coupons</li>
		<li>Gift Certificate style coupons</li>
	</ul>

						<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Specific: The discount is calculated as a percentage of the total of the products configured in the coupon that are in the shopping cart

		<br>This coupon will work for the 7 customers chosen as long as their shopping cart has a minimum total of 120 and at least one product in the cart is one of the 3 chosen in the coupon.

Each of the customers selected can use this coupon a total of 3 times.  Since it has no expiration date, it never expires, but with the restrictions set, it effectively expires after all 7 customers use the coupon on 3 seperate occasions each.
